# Population Density Hackathon information

This repository is primarily used to showcase a brief amount of code demonstrating how to make differential equations over a graph representation work. To see this open `index.html` in your favourite web browser.    

There is other sample code in the repository - but the quality is not guarenteed.       

To find relevant, cleaned, population data files use this google drive -> [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_RfRwYjZ_rv7FzS2_ooafXj6vTUZ-SoP?usp=drive_link)      

To use the `index.html` file properly (for the time being being) make a directory in populationDensity_2024 called `diffusion_plots` and run all cells in `generate.ipynb`
